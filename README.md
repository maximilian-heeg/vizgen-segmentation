# Vizgen segmentation

A nextflow pipeline for segmentation of Vizgen Merscope runs. The pipeline consists of the following parts:

- Assign transcripts to cells based on the cellpose segmentationaion done by Vizgen.
- Create smaller tiles of the dataset. For more information see [tile-xenium](https://github.com/maximilian-heeg/tile-xenium).
- Run Baysor on all tiles. This step uses [Baysor](https://github.com/kharchenkolab/Baysor) wrapped in a [docker image](https://github.com/maximilian-heeg/baysor-container).
- Merge the segmentation results to get one final segmentation. This [program](https://github.com/maximilian-heeg/merge-baysor) merges cells based on an IOU threshold.



## Usage

The pipeline requires a working installation of [nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/). Further, it uses [singularity/apptainer](https://apptainer.org/) to run the scripts in reproducible environments.
Run the pipeline with:

    nextflow run maximilian-heeg/vizgen-segmentaion -r v0.1.0 \
    --input.transcripts detected_transcripts.csv \
    --input.pixel_transformation micron_to_mosaic_pixel_transform.csv \
    --input.tiff mosaic_Cellbound3_z3.tif \
    --input.boundary cellpose_micron_space.parquet
### Parameters

Many parameters can be manually set (and might need to be adjusted for best reuslts.)

These parameters can either be changed by adding the parameters to the command (`--baysor.min_molecules_per_cell 60`) or by creating a `nextflow.config` file within the working directory.

<pre>
// Change the min_molecules_per_cell for Baysor
params {
    baysor.min_molecules_per_cell = <strong>60</strong>
}
</pre>

### Executors

> In the Nextflow framework architecture, the executor is the component that determines the system where a pipeline process is run and supervises its execution.
> 
> The executor provides an abstraction between the pipeline processes and the underlying execution system. This allows you to write the pipeline functional logic independently from the actual processing platform.
> 
> In other words, you can write your pipeline script once and have it running on your computer, a cluster resource manager, or the cloud â€” simply change the executor definition in the Nextflow configuration file.

Again, you can set an executor by modifying the `nextflow.config`.

<pre>
// Use the PBS scheduler
process {
    executor = 'pbs'
    queue = 'home-yeo'
}
</pre>
